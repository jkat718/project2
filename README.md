# Project 3
Team New York
- Huiyu Yang
- Jason Katzner
- Leah Goodwin

## Changes to Original Project 2 Design
- increased padding and margins; decreased proximity between header and interests to create seperation; changed layout of interests, de-grouped contact info from interests
- replaced neon color scheme to be easier on the eye; new scheme referencing colors similar to those in eclipse for engineer/computer science theme
- fixed interest pictures to bottom of their box and gave them a backboard to make them more uniform
- added bottom border to h3 to create seperation between h3 and body text, as they are close in size
- added background to footer to balance between filled shapes and lines
