						<h3>Engineers Without Borders</h3>
						<p>I am a project lead in Engineers Without Borders. My team and I are working on providing clean drinking water to a rural Tanzanian village. Currently, they have to travel 20km each way to a contaminated water source. I have several duties like coordinating meetings, communicating with contacts throughout the world, and writing applications for the national organization.</p>
