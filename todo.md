- Pick approved Z-pattern and F-pattern
- Five webpages
	-   A homepage (Z-pattern)
	-  A student list (F-pattern)
	-   Three student pages that uses any appropriate layout	
- Navigation:
	-   Only one link to go from the homepage to the student list, and one link back
	-   The student list (F-pattern) does not need another navigation element to get to all the student pages; the links in the F-pattern will suffice
	-   The three student pages need links to get back to the student list (F-pattern) and the homepage (Z-pattern)
